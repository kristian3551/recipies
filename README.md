# RECIPIES

Recipies is my project for ReactJS course. The main concept is: 
- creating and sharing different cooking recipies. You can create your own recipe and share it with other users.
- evaluating other people's recipies by liking them
- commenting other people's recipies

## Running the project

1. First, open the server-side folder called *server* and type: __npm install__ as well as __npm run nodemon__.
2. Second, open the client folder and type in the terminal: __npm install__. Run ReactJS with __npm start__.

## Comming soon

There are some updates that are coming soon like:
  * better comments (addded replies and stuff)
  * user page (with recipies added by the current user)
  * better styling (as we all know, I don't know any CSS :D)
