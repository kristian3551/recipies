# recipies

Recipies is my project for ReactJS course. The main concept is: 
- creating and sharing different cooking recipies
- evaluating other people's recipies

# Running the project

1. First open the client folder and type in the terminal: __npm install__
2. To run the client-side application just type: __npm start__
3. Open the server-side folder called *server* and type: __npm install__ as well as __npm run nodemon__
